## Installation
1. Install BepInEx for Enter the Gungeon
2. Copy `GungeonTogether.dll` to `[ETG Install]/BepInEx/plugins/`
3. Launch Enter the Gungeon

## Building
This only applies to people who want to build from source, or if we forget to post builds :)
1. Setup BepInExPack_ETG (not holding your hand, google it)
2. Run the build script `build.ps1` in the GungeonTogether folder
3. Launch Enter the Gungeon

## Technical Details
Built with BepInEx framework using Steam P2P networking for a seamless multiplayer experience.
Unfortunately if you play the game through epic or windows store this mod will not work, as it runs through steams p2p api only, which means you need a steamID for it to work. Sorry guys...

# 1.0 release coming one day!!!!!!
